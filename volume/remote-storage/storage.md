## Remote-storage ##
In Kubernetes, PV (Persistent Volume), PVC (Persistent Volume Claim), and StorageClass are all related to storage management.

## Persistent Volume (PV) ##
A Persistent Volume is a piece of storage in the Kubernetes cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically via a StorageClass. It is a cluster-wide resource that exists independently of any pod, and it represents the actual storage resource. It could be backed by any storage system such as local disks, NFS, cloud storage.

## Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) ##
A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. When you create a PVC, you're asking Kubernetes to either find or create a PV that meets the specific storage requirements (such as size, access modes, and storage class) specified in the claim.

## StorageClass ##
A StorageClass is a way to define different types of storage in Kubernetes. It provides a way to dynamically provision PVs with specific properties, such as performance or replication levels, depending on the storage back end (like SSD vs. HDD).
StorageClass defines a "blueprint" for the storage (e.g., type of disk, replication).
